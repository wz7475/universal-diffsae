        scheduler (`SchedulerMixin`):
            The scheduler to get timesteps from.
        num_inference_steps (`int`):
            The number of diffusion steps used when generating samples with a pre-trained model. If used, `timesteps`

        device (`str` or `torch.device`, *optional*):
            The device to which the timesteps should be moved to. If `None`, the timesteps are not moved.
        timesteps (`List[int]`, *optional*):
